              In February of 2020, my wife started her own business as a dog trainer. In November of 2020, she was scheduled to have surgery which was going to require a 3 to 4-week recovery time. We had planned for this,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


















              my employer included, by me saving all my vacation time for this period. At around the same time is when
              COVID-19 started having a greater impact locally. I ended up being off work for 2 months straight. During
              this period, my wife and I discussed me leaving my then current job and coming home to help her. She had
              tried hiring several different people so they could assist her and was unable to find someone with a drive
              and passion for animals, coupled with a sense of responsibility. For various reasons, I was looking for a
              change. Not so much in my carrier, per-say. But simply a chance to do something more. After 16 years at
              Rayco, Inc, I felt like I had nowhere else to go or anything else to offer. And learning how to train dogs
              was going to be a whole new world that I was free to explore. Since I was going to be self-employed, the
              only ladder I had to climb was the one I propped up for myself. If I wanted to go higher, at any time, I
              could. And I did! I have enjoyed this time tremendously and do not regret my decision to leave my old job
              in the slightest. During these last few years, I have grown so much and even at 50 years of age I feel as
              though I have matured. Slightly. I have a new-found respect for business owners and the mental capacity
              needed to maintain that business. I have never worked harder in my life than I have since leaving my old
              job.

              Technology, and science in general, is still one of my deepest passions and I find ways to incorporate it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 




















              whenever I can. Be it through my 25+ yrs of web development experience or figuring out ways to utilize our

              Dabbling in web development over the last 25+ years has been a blessing and a curse. I am the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 




















              quintessential _"Jack of all trades, master of none!"_ if I am being completely honest. I have a ton of
              experience in a lot of different areas, but never really feel like I have mastered a single one. Then
              again, that can be a good thing. I am very open minded and have never felt the need to follow any flow or
              trend in the industry. I have a few tools that I have built over the years and when I want to learn
              something new, I rebuild those tools. Compound Learning, I think that's what is called. Maybe I made that
              up? Either way, I love to code. I love to solve problems. And I love helping people with problems. I don't
              mind reaching into a box to find the answers, but I am also not afraid to think outside of the box to get
              to a solution. I feel that these aspects of my personality are very valuable that I can bring to the
              table. I have a very strong work ethic and I am not afraid to get my hands dirty. I have a very strong
              sense of responsibility and I take pride in my work. I am not afraid to ask for help when I need it, but I
              also do not mind helping others when they need it. I am a very loyal person and I will always do my best
              to help those around me. I am a very positive person and I try to see the good in everything. I am a very
              open-minded person and I try to be as inclusive as possible. I am a very patient person and I try to be as
              understanding as possible. I am a very compassionate person and I try to be as empathetic as possible.
