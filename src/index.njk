              Hello! I have no idea how you ended up here, but otherwise, I will
              apologize for what seems like either a run of bad luck for you or
              maybe your just having a bad day. Either way, I am glad your here.
              My name is
              <b>Phillip Jackson</b>,
              <i>a.k.a</i>
              <b>Unisys12</b>. Online, most of my friends call me Uni.

              In February of 2020, my wife started her own business as a dog
              trainer. In November of 2020, she was scheduled to have surgery
              which was going to require a 3 to 4-week recovery time. We had
              planned for this, my employer included, by me saving all my
              vacation time for this period. At around the same time is when
              COVID-19 started having a greater impact locally. I ended up being
              off work for 2 months straight. During this period, my wife and I
              discussed me leaving my then current job and coming home to help
              her. She had tried hiring several different people so they could
              assist her and was unable to find someone with a drive and passion
              for animals, coupled with a sense of responsibility. For various
              reasons, I was looking for a change. Not so much in my carrier,
              per-say. But simply a chance to do something more. After 16 years
              at Rayco, Inc, I felt like I had nowhere else to go or anything
              else to offer. And learning how to train dogs was going to be a
              whole new world that I was free to explore. Since I was going to
              be self-employed, the only ladder I had to climb was the one I
              propped up for myself. If I wanted to go higher, at any time, I
              could. And I did! I have enjoyed this time tremendously and do not
              regret my decision to leave my old job in the slightest. During
              these last few years, I have grown so much and even at 50 years of
              age I feel as though I have matured. Slightly. I have a new-found
              respect for business owners and the mental capacity needed to
              maintain that business. I have never worked harder in my life than
              I have since leaving my old job.

              Technology, and science in general, is still one of my deepest
              passions and I find ways to incorporate it whenever I can. Be it
              through my 25+ yrs of web development experience or figuring out
              ways to utilize our Office 365 Grant to the fullest.

              Dabbling in web development over the last 25+ years has been a
              blessing and a curse. I am the quintessential _"Jack of all trades,
              master of none!"_ if I am being completely honest. I have a ton of
              experience in a lot of different areas, but never really feel like
              I have mastered a single one. Then again, that can be a good
              thing. I am very open minded and have never felt the need to follow
              any flow or trend in the industry. I have a few tools that I have
              built over the years and when I want to learn something new, I
              rebuild those tools. Compound Learning, I think that's what is
              called. Maybe I made that up? Either way, I love to code. I love
              to solve problems. And I love helping people with problems. I don't
              mind reaching into a box to find the answers, but I am also not
              afraid to think outside of the box to get to a solution. I feel
              that these aspects of my personality are very valuable that I can
              bring to the table. I have a very strong work ethic and I am not
              afraid to get my hands dirty. I have a very strong sense of
              responsibility and I take pride in my work. I am not afraid to ask
              for help when I need it, but I also do not mind helping others
              when they need it. I am a very loyal person and I will always do
              my best to help those around me. I am a very positive person and I
              try to see the good in everything. I am a very open-minded person
              and I try to be as inclusive as possible. I am a very patient
              person and I try to be as understanding as possible. I am a very
              compassionate person and I try to be as empathetic as possible.
